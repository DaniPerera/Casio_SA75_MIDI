## Casio SA-75 MIDI conversion V2
#BETA
This is the upgraded version of the previous MIDI conversion kit.

### Features
- Same features as the previous one
- Has more free pins in the Arduino to add more peripherals.

# Still working with the code to properly map the keyboard input. So it only gives random keypresses. Schematic and the code will be updated once everything is working as intended.
